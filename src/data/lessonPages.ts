        + 'One octave includes 7 white and 5 black keys. The white keys are the main musical notes (A, B, C, D, E, F, G),'
        + 'and the black keys are their semitones (sharps and flats). We will start learning the basic notes already'

        + 'community of musicians has determined that A is the most perceived note by human hearing, so'

        + "Higher sounds are recorded on the upper lines, and lower sounds are recorded on the lower ones."

        + "clefs are placed at the beginning of the musical string.",
        text3: "Let's talk about the treble clef for now. With the help of a treble clef, the sounds corresponding to the"
        + "right (upper) half of the keyboard are written. The treble clef is also called the G clef, since its curl surrounds"
        + "the line on which the sol note of the first octave is located.",
        text4: "Knowing this, we can easily determine the location on the staff of other sounds in the treble clef! Let's go"
        + "down to the note of C and go up to the note of B. Sometimes not all notes fit into the sheet music, so additional"
        + "lines appear (as in the case of the note C). Sounds easy, right?",
